# Intro to CSS Grid

## Learning Objectives
- Study the basic concepts of CSS Grid Layout
- Apply those concepts by building our own grids in Codepen
- Identify common pitfalls and misconceptions
- Equip ourselves with a variety of learning resources

## The Fundamentals of CSS Grid Layout
So what is CSS Grid? An actual, bona fide, honest-to-God **two-dimensional layout** in CSS. Here's what we get right out of the box:
- **P**recise item placement
- **I**mplicit grid
- **V**ertical and horizontal alignment
- **O**verlapping content
- **T**rack sizing

Yes, you read that correctly: we can now PIVOT.

> This isn't an industry-approved acronym, but it works and you may find it helpful. Also, I really wanted to use this gif, okay? Okay.

### Containers and Items and Tracks, Oh My!
We'll do some PIVOTing shortly, but first, let's establish some basic vocabulary.

When we work with Grid, we have a parent element - the **grid container** - and the direct children of that grid container - the **grid items**. 

Grid items can be placed in **grid columns** and **grid rows**. These columns and rows define **grid tracks**.

If this seems abstract right now, don't worry. It will get clearer as we build this stuff ourselves.

### Precise item placement
### Implicit grid
### Vertical and horizontal alignment
### Overlapping content
### Track sizing
